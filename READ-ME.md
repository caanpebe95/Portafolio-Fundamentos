# Portafolio-Fundamentos

Hi and welcome to my portfolio. This is my first work with HTML and CSS. It's the basics we learn at Academlo and it's the very first course I formally take to learn coding and programming.

You will notice that I used an additional FrontEndMentor challenge resource and tried to copy the design as much as possible. I updated the content to present a Colombian software company.

All the original designs, as well as the mobile and desktop designs, are listed under the Additional-resources folder in this repository. 

Finally, I would like to add that this was a whole new challenge for me. There are improvements to apply to the website. Therefore I'm still practicing and studying everyday to push the portfolio to a new level.

Thanks for your time to read these words and good programming!
